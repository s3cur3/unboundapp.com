        <section class="primary">
            <p>With the announcement of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">App Store Small Business Program</a>, I&#8217;ve stopped selling Unbound directly via the web site. I thought it would be worth explaining how I came to that decision.</p>
            <p>The original motivation for selling the app directly was simple: Apple took a 30% cut of sales, whereas <a href="https://paddle.com">Paddle</a>, the payment processor &amp; authentication tool I was using to sell directly only took [<em>not-publicly-disclosed-but-substantially-less-than&#8211;30</em>]%. With the drop in Mac App Store fees, that gap has shrunk considerably&#8230; to the point that it&#8217;s no longer worth keeping Paddle around.</p>
            <h2 id="directsalesareaworseexperienceforcustomers">1. Direct sales are a worse experience for customers.</h2>
            <p>From a customer&#8217;s perspective, every direct sale is its own little special snowflake, and you have to figure out how to get your license key, where in the app to enter it, etc. </p>
            <p>For the most tech-savvy users, this is pretty much a non-issue (until, of course, you migrate to a new computer and have to dig through your email to find your product key—good luck!). But a substantial percentage of users had trouble with this, and it was the #1 source of support requests for me.</p>
            <p>In contrast, virtually <em>every</em> Mac user is familiar with the Mac App Store. (And even if they aren&#8217;t, it can&#8217;t be a <em>worse</em> experience than trying to figure out a third-party platform!) Moving installs between machines is a non-issue, and there&#8217;s no such thing as an activation problem. </p>
            <h2 id="directsalesincreasetheoverheadofeachrelease">2. Direct sales increase the overhead of each release.</h2>
            <p>Unbound is not my day job, and revenue-wise, it probably doesn&#8217;t have any conceivable path to become my full-time income. (I&rsquo;m measuring my income here in <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerAYoung/status/1341815721182056465" target="_blank">lattes per month</a>!) That means I can only work on it during nights &amp; weekends—a rather limited amount of time.</p>
            <p>For that reason, I want to maximize the time I actually spend shipping new features. Selling directly meant that I had to cut two builds, and go through two release processes, every time I wanted to ship an update. (And of course I&#8217;ve already mentioned the support burden of direct sales—support takes time directly away from development!)</p>
            <h2 id="directsalesareasecurityandprivacyliability">3. Direct sales are a security and privacy liability.</h2>
            <p>If Paddle suffered a data breach, suddenly <em>I</em> would be on the hook for exposing people&#8217;s emails or (God forbid) credit card data. While this has <em>not</em> happened, and I have no reason whatsoever to think Paddle is anything but competent, I&#8217;m still much happier trusting Apple&#8217;s security practices than <em>any</em> third party. (And if <em>Apple</em> has a security breach, I feel like I&#8217;m unlikely to take the blame from customers—the vast majority of them have done business with Apple directly in the past, whether for their computers, phones, or even just iTunes purchases.)</p>
            <p>Even apart from a data breach, removing all third parties from the equation is a privacy win for customers—I can proudly tell people the app collects <em>no</em> data whatsoever, whereas Paddle had to &#8220;phone home&#8221; to validate product keys.</p>
            <h2 id="itsjustnotworthitanymore">It&#8217;s just not worth it any more.</h2>
            <p>Given all that, the math just doesn&#8217;t work out in support of doing direct sales any more. Even if I moved sales to accepting credit cards directly, a 3.5% fee with all those downsides is substantially worse for both me and my customers than a flat 15%.</p>
            <p>Onward and upward!</p>
